# Welcome

Please install Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ to get started with running the notebooks locally. You may also optionally make use of Google colaboratory and upload the notebooks there.

The popular libraries we will be working with are Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Tensorflow.
